## PSIT Charlotte Neighborhood Analysis

Run the notebook `C:\Users\bhavy\Downloads\Bhavya psit project.ipynb` to generate exportable assets.

Outputs (created in a `figures/` folder next to the notebook when you run it):
- PNG charts: demographics and place-making
- HTML maps: parks, recreation, transportation, education/libraries, wellness/safety, healthcare PSIT, finance, land

If GitHub does not render interactive maps, commit the HTML files and link to them directly in the repo.

### Exported Charts (PNG)
